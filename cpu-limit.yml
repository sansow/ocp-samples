#set CPU limits for each pod in their Kubernetes environment using YAML configuration files. In this example, we'll create a YAML file defining a pod with a CPU limit of 8 vCPUs:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "8"
