Set up Quay as a mirror registry on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) cluster, follow these structured steps:
Prerequisites
  Ensure you have administrative access to your ARO cluster.
  Have an Azure account and necessary permissions to create resources.
  Familiarity with the OpenShift web console and command-line interface (CLI).
  
Step 1: Create Azure Resources
    Create Resource Group:
    Log into the Azure portal.
    Navigate to "Resource groups" and create a new resource group.
    Create Storage Account:
    In the Azure portal, search for "Storage accounts".
    Click "Create" and fill in the required details such as resource group, storage account name, and performance options.
    After creation, navigate to the storage account and create a new container within it. Set the privacy level to "Public access blob".
    Access Keys:
    Within your storage account, go to "Access keys" and note down the Storage Account Name and Access Key for later use.
      
Step 2: Install Red Hat Quay Operator
    OpenShift Console:
    Log into the OpenShift web console using your admin credentials.
    Install Quay Operator:
    Navigate to Operators > OperatorHub.
    Search for "Red Hat Quay" and click on it.
    Click "Install" and choose to install it in all namespaces or a specific one based on your preference.
      
Step 3: Configure Quay Registry
    Create Quay Registry Instance:
    Go to Operators > Installed Operators > Red Hat Quay.
    Click on "Quay Registry" and then "Create QuayRegistry".
    Fill in the form or YAML view with necessary configurations, including:
    Storage Engine: Select "Azure Blob Storage".
    Container Name: Enter the name of the container created earlier.
    Account Name and Key: Use the Storage Account Name and Access Key noted earlier.
    Validate Configuration:
    After filling in the details, click "Validate Configuration Changes" and then "Reconfigure Quay".
      
Step 4: Set Up Mirroring
    Configure Image Content Sources:
    Modify your install-config.yaml file to include image content sources that point to your Quay registry. For example:
    text
    imageContentSources:
    - mirrors:
      - myimageregistry.example.com:8443/ocp4/openshift4
      source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
    
    Mirror Images:
    Use the OpenShift CLI to mirror images from Quay to your local registry using commands like:
    bash
    oc adm release mirror \
      --from=quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} \
      --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
      --insecure \
      -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON}

Step 5: Verify Setup
    Confirm that your Quay registry is operational by accessing its console.
    Check that images are being mirrored correctly by pushing an image to your registry and verifying its presence.
